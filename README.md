# Summary 

- I have created an interactive sales dashboard for Awesome Chocolates, a fictional company. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key sales metrics and offers two levels of filters for enhanced visualization.
- At the **KPI level**, you can track important performance indicators such as overall sales, total cost, total profit, total sales volume, total boxes sold, and profit percentage.
- For a detailed view, the dashboard offers **country-wise sales and profit analysis**, showcasing the performance of outlets in New Zealand, Australia, India, Canada, USA, and UK.
- You can also explore **team-wise sales and profit metrics**, including individual salesperson data and their respective sales and profit contributions. This allows for a granular understanding of team performance.
- **Product-wise sales analysis** provides insights into the sales, profit, boxes sold, and profit percentages for each chocolate category, including chocolate bars, bites, and others.
- To facilitate easy exploration, the dashboard incorporates **two levels of filters**, enabling you to dynamically sort and present data based on product categories and teams.
- Lastly, the dashboard **highlights the top three best-selling products**, giving you quick visibility into the most successful items.
